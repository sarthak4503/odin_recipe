    <p>A maximum of 30 minutes if what you will need to create this amazingly delicious Indian Style Masala Pasta. So, on days, when you are confused as to what you’re craving for more – whether Indian or Italian – then just go for this dish!

        Masala Pasta and masala noodles are a favorite with many people, as well as kids. It not only makes for a tasty fusion treat but also is filling and comforting too. Imagine watching your favorite series or movie on Netflix with a bowl of hot Masala Pasta. Isn’t it just the perfect scenario?
        
        I personally am not that much of a fan, when it comes to pastas. However, I do make some dishes like this Masala Pasta which is liked by everyone at home. So, whenever this dish, my choice of variety of pasta is usually the penne.
