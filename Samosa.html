    <h1>Samosa</h1>

    <p>use a bit less water than some other recipes to make my dough, which creates an ever flakier and crave-able samosa crust. (This is also the trick I use to make samosa pie, which is a great non-fried alternative to traditional samosa.)

        Plus, the filling in these Punjabi Samosa is just fantastic. It’s super easy to prepare in a stovetop pressure cooker or using an Instant Pot and in a pan on the stove.
        
        Green peas and potatoes are blended with classic Indian spices for a warm, satisfying stuffing that will keep you wanting more.
        
        With a perfect crust and comforting filling, this recipe is a real winner! Give it a try and you’ll be amazed at how simple and fun it is to make samosa recipe from scratch at home.
        
        Our personal favorite is and will always be a Punjabi Samosa which is what this recipe is all about. The classic potato and green peas stuffing in this recipe is adapted from my cooking school notes.
